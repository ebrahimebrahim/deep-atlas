# deep-atlas
An exploration of the DeepAtlas registration and segmentation methodology.

The main attraction is `deep_atlas_tutorial.ipynb`, but this tutorial notebook is now maintained
in the [MONAI tutorials repository](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/tutorials/tree/master/deep_atlas).

See the wiki for some notes on the current efforts going on in this repository.

## TOC generation

Jupyter notebooks cannot automatically generate a table of contents,
so if you edit the headings then you can run `generate_toc.sh deep_atlas_tutorial.ipynb`
to generate a new TOC.
