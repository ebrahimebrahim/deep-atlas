# deep-atlas
An exploration of the DeepAtlas registration and segmentation methodology

The main attraction is `deep_atlas_tutorial.ipynb`.

Jupyter notebooks cannot automatically generate a table of contents,
so if you edit the headings then you can run `generate_toc.sh deep_atlas_tutorial.ipynb`
to generate a new TOC.
